## STS Web Crawler
Science Talent Search is the most distinguished science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) competition for high school seniors. The [official website](https://www.societyforscience.org/regeneron-sts/2025-scholars/) will release the TOP 300 scholar's information. The code in the notebook can load the content from the web, extract the selected information in json via LLM model and transform them into DataFrame.<br>
